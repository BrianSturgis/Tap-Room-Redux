# Keg Tracker 
<p align="center"> Authored by Brian Sturgis</p>
<p align="center">Project started on July 2nd, 2021</p>

## Description
This is an application for a Bar to track their keg inventory and more specifically   dw.

## user stories
As a user can see a list/menu of all available kegs. They can see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.
A user can submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
A user can click on a keg to see its detail page.
A user can see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
A user can click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This will decrease the number of pints left by 1. 

### Known Bugs
- keg refill button does not top off keg it adds 124 pints and is not the expectation of the function.
- css styling (tap room logo, etc) is in build state and barely a wire frame.
- all fields requiring integers must receive them or the keg must be re updated completely for the math to properly reduce the keg amount by one pint at a time.

### using the application
app must be run from its fundamentals branch

### `npm install`
This app uses node.js. If you do not already have node.js installed, visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install.
After installing node..
- navigate to the root directory of the cloned repo in a as Command Prompt or Git Bash.
- Type in "npm install".
- Type in "npm run build".

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
